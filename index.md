I wrote this lesson but, in point of fact, I don't actually expect students to
set up their own Raspberry Pi. Instead, I give them an SD card that is already
set up. But we go through this guide so that they understand what has been done
and can do the process for themselves when necessary.

This guide makes no assumptions beyond needing a Raspberry Pi computer and a WiFi
