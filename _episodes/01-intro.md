In this course, you'll be using a Raspberry Pi single-board computer for most of the 
work. There's nothing magical about the Raspberry Pi: it's just an inexpensive computer 
running Debian linux. You could do the same kinds of things with your laptop or an old 
desktop computer. But we're going to use a Raspberry Pi.

Although one is being provided to you for the class, its worth taking a few minutes to 
check your kit and to consider how to purchase and select components for when you need 
to get another.

The Raspberry Pi 4 comes in several different flavors depending on how much RAM the 
board offers. For most basic projects, the least expensive is entirely adequate. 
The only exception would be for doing extensive computation, for example, image 
analysis or audio processing. And for these, it might worth looking at other 
platforms that are specialized for those purposes.

The Pi itself is a single board. The other necessary components include a 
micro-SD card, which acts as the computer's long-term storage for the operating 
system and associated files, and a power supply. It turns out SD cards are highly 
variable, so check the [Raspbian documentation for information about choosing 
one](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/sd-cards.md). Until 
your Pi is configured, you'll need to borrow a keyboard and a display (and a 
mouse might turn out to be handy). And you might want a case to keep your Pi 
in, so you don't accidentally damage it.

Your kit may come with head-sinks or a fan. Check the documentation carefully to 
set up the board with the fan and heat-sinks before you assemble the kit.

> ## Important:
>
> Be sure to wait to insert the SD card until after you have put the Raspberry 
Pi into the case. Otherwise, you may accidentally get the card caught and put 
force on the connector damaging it.
