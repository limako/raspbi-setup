Your Raspberry Pi is a computer on the internet. There are people constantly scanning computers on the internet looking for vulnerable devices to compromise. If your computer gets compromised, it could make all of your data suspect but, more importantly, it could be used to spy on you and to attack other computers on the internet. A few minutes spent learning how to keep it secure can pay big dividends.
